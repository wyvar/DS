# DS (Discord Stalky)

## Monologue
Okay okay Hear me out. I'm trying to make cv, i don't like doing simple projects like use api to create app, cuase... Idk most people are doing it better and i feel opreesed when looking at it. Soooo... Yeah Stalky bot - anywy to the story

I finished 1/2 of facebook bot, and my mind went... Hmmm Facebook is kinda dying - more people are sittin' on discord and are more active then on messenger.
So what Wyvar Could do? Hop into Discord on a Browser.

Before you say - but wyvar, there are bots created, jsut use them.

I say: NO SHUT UP, i want to be stealhy and not screaming - LOOK THIS SERVER HAS BOT!! WOOOHOO. And in addition i want it to be as simple as possible

## Story

I jumped on the discord and the friend list - Yay everyone active stays in the active EASY PEASY GOOD BYE. 

But let's be honest - most of your friends are on server and you never added them to friend list.
SO LET'S SCRAP ACTIVITY FROM THE SERVER!!!

We could, but we would need to scroll on some servers 10 min to get to the bottom to check certain person... That would or would not be active... Bad idea.. So let's stick to previous plan.

Okay so what else can we do to get "More"? Well You messeged your friend at least one time, showing some super funny and cringy meme, don't ya mate? So why not scroll through Private Messages? To be honest it's good and bad idea - theoreticly same problem like with a server..
</br> BUT! </br>
If we scrollin through the server we can set some.. Tini Tiny Account to block the rest Or limit to the most recent.. Soooo.. Also bad. Cause to get whole list we need to count rooms + during scroll users are dynamiclly assigned, so they are gone from the html source code untill you scroll back up.
</br>If we can't get everyone let's get only the user, certain chat, that we check maybe in few cards? Thx to that we can switch between them.. YAY! 
So let's copy their id and put it in the https://discord.com/channels/@me/UserID and.. 

WRONG! </br>
  So Discord forsaw the dark future of bots going through every person gathering their personal info and (unlike facebook that change it to custom nicknames, but still can find user by id) got maybe a better idea - Let's think about "direct message" as "chatroom", and we will asign those people to the chatroom, but as private (2 people) in case if anyone joins it will automatically transfer them to new room. This room can be accessed only by users with premission. </br>
  So back to square one. We've got nothing... You need to have friends and you can't stalk your random UwU OwO quirky girfliend, who is a boy and gets money from you. 

Well.. We just need a link... And we are good to go... But where is it? [WHERE IS THE LAST MOON](https://youtu.be/bAxyxlkD_g0?t=12)?! Is it the hidden request as in facebook? OH no it's is attached to metadata in photos. How i can get it without geting into the chat? OH NO? WHERE IS IT? WHERE IS IT?

Oh... In private messages list there is a strange tag - people__XXXXXXXXXXXXX ... and attached to it.... OH SHIET IT"S THE LINK...
So yeah.. Despite Discord being sneaky and throwing 99% into metadata, that it's hard to access due to requierments, the link to the chat is not dynamicly generated.
